## Your TA Assignemnt
The TA assignments have been finalized. Please refer to the schedule in this page. I kindly ask for your assistance in completing the lab roster. Please fill in your name and GitHub ID in the corresponding session on the spreadsheet at [link](https://kansas-my.sharepoint.com/:x:/g/personal/z461y203_home_ku_edu/Ececqi7iUMVHo_G78EQPKKoBHWDzuRpHkNF_nVs4A3iD0w?e=OgfNLt). Our GTA will invite you to join our GitHub organization, where you'll be able to create your repository as instructed in Lab 1.

Your TA is assigned based on the sessions that you belong to. You can locate your TA at Enroll\&Pay. Meanwhile, we are in the process of forming groups at canvas `People` -> `Groups` where you can also find your TA assignment. Contacts of TAs are as follows:

- Mallojula, Prashanthi (Email: <prashanthi.mallojula@ku.edu>, Github: [Prashanthimallojula](https://github.com/Prashanthimallojula))
- Pudota, Mary Jeevana (Email: <maryjeevanapudota@ku.edu>, Github: [pjscience46](https://github.com/pjscience46))
- Gundla, Sai Rithvik (Email: <sairithvik@ku.edu>, Github: [sairithvik800](https://github.com/sairithvik800))

Each lab session is scheduled and instructed as follows:

- Monday 08:00-09:50a.m. (**GTA**: Mallojula, Prashanthi)
- Tuesday 02:00-03:50p.m. (**GTA**: Mallojula, Prashanthi)
- Tuesday 04:00-05:50p.m. (**GTA**: Gundla, Sai Rithvik)
- Wednesday 08:00-09:50a.m. (**GTA**: Pudota, Mary Jeevana)
- Friday 11:00-12:50p.m. (**GTA**: Gundla, Sai Rithvik)

## Due Dates
Due dates of each lab assignment will be clearly indicated at the beginning of each lab document. Basically, you will have **4 days** after your lab date to finish all the submission. For example: if your lab is every Monday, you will have Tuesday - Friday to finish your assignment. The due time will be 11:59pm CDT on every Friday.


## Policy
Please read the following instruction carefully:

- Students who would need to **occasionally attend** their lab on the other sessions (e.g., Monday is your assigned lab, but you need to attend the lab on Wednesday for this week), you can have **2 chances** to do that in maximum. Again, the seat is not guaranteed, you can either wait for available lab seat or bring your own laptop. Accordingly, your due date will be reflected as a new date as the lab you switch to. You are **responsible** for notifying the TAs of your original lab and the lab you will attend, so that TAs will update your due date.

- Students who wish to **perminantly switch** their lab session (e.g., you have another class at your lab session), you need to find a classmate who is willing to take your old seat perminantly. Once you two agree to exhange your lab sessions, let your TAs know and your names will be exchange perminantly in our lab roster (Your due dates will be updated). You will have two weeks (until **Sept 9th**) to do this if you are interested. Any request after this date, will not be accepted. Your due date will be fixed.

- Students who **have questions** regarding their lab assignments, you can walk to any lab sessions and TAs will help you. Please keep in mind that your due date will **NOT changed**. 

- Lab attendance will not be enforced, but incentive credit (up to 1 pts overall) will be awarded to regular lab attendence and discussion.
