## Policy
Please read the following instruction carefully:

- Students who would need to **occasionally attend** their lab on the other sessions (e.g., Monday is your assigned lab, but you need to attend the lab on Wednesday for this week), you can have **2 chances** to do that in maximum. Again, the seat is not guaranteed, you can either wait for available lab seat or bring your own laptop. Accordingly, your due date will be reflected as a new date as the lab you switch to. You are **responsible** for notifying the TAs of your original lab and the lab you will attend, so that TAs will update your due date.

- Students who wish to **perminantly switch** their lab session (e.g., you have another class at your lab session), you need to find a classmate who is willing to take your old seat perminantly. Once you two agree to exhange your lab sessions, let your TAs know and your names will be exchange perminantly in our lab roster (Your due dates will be updated). You will have two weeks (until **Sept 9th**) to do this if you are interested. Any request after this date, will not be accepted. Your due date will be fixed.

- Students who **have questions** regarding their lab assignments, you can walk to any lab sessions and TAs will help you. Please keep in mind that your due date will **NOT changed**. 

- Lab attendance will not be enforced, but incentive credit (up to 1 pts overall) will be awarded to regular lab attendence and discussion.
